                    About Me
                </h2>
                <p>My name is Matt. I am computer scientist by trade, and an enthusiast by hobby.</p>
                <p>I began my journey on Long Island, where I resided for just eleven months. 
                    From there I moved to a small town in Dutchess County, NY, called Stormville. 
                    I characterize it as a forest on a mountain with a few peppered trees.
                    I also spent a few years living in Waterloo, Belgium. Currently, I live with my brother in Danbury, CT.</p>
                <p>I attended University at Buffalo where I purused a degree in computer science.
                    After my sophomore year I decided I wanted to specialize my education in cybersecurity, 
                    I then trasnfered to State University of New York College at Plattsburgh to study and receive a B.S. in Computer Security.
                    Since graduating in May 2017 I have pursued a somewhat varied career path, 
                    I started out as a penetration tester and soon moved onto systems and linux engineering.
                    The highlight achievement of my college and post college career thus far has been the development of multiple
                    Artificial Neural Networks for various tasks, ask me about them if you are interested!</p>
                <p>I like to think I am something of a hobbyist. I play many instruments, have lots of pet fish, and tons of house plants.
                    I love to read and have been working on a fourteen book epic-fantasy series for the past four years now called "The Wheel of Time".
                    Fellow fantasy nuts: I highly recomend this series! I work on a lot of software development projects in my spare time. 
                    Such as the aforementioned Artificial Neural Networks.
                    Lastly, as an ex-boy scout and current Eagle Scout, I am an avid outdoorsman. I love to hike, bike, kayak, canoe, fish, camp, 
                    and so much more! </p>
